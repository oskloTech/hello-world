# hello-world
One small step for Git Hub, one massive step for self-learning. Creating this repository as a starting point.

Looking to start my learning with coding and software development. I already have some ideras for different tools to develop.
I am familiar with HTML-5 and CSS, looking to expand this to functional coding.
